The 2020 Experience is a hectic 1v1 local multiplayer game helping make your 2021 better by reliving 2020's toilet paper madness. Move the yellow player using WASD and the orange player using the arrow keys and try to grab the toilet paper back to your house. But be careful: avoid the very sick blue CPUs, lest you succumb to COVID-19! And if your opponent or a CPU steals the toilet paper, you're going to have to take your chances and knock the toilet paper out of their hands so you can return home victorious!
